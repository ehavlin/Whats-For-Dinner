# What-s-For-Dinner

This app is designed to make lifeâ€™s dinner decisions easy. When the user starts the app they will be prompted to select if they want to eat out or eat at home. Once they have decided the app will allow them to now input the restaurants or meals that sound good to them. If they do not wish to do this they will also have the decision to choose one of our preloaded meals. After a list has been created the meal/restaurant will be chosen at random for them.  At any time the user will be able to change their mind and submit a new list, change their mind on eating in or out, or simply ask for a new random selection. 

This was a project created for CS 222 (Advanced Programming) Fall Semester 2015 at Ball State University.
